# cigar-directory-manager

A cigar directory. I should be able to add, remove, view and search cigar types. Each cigar should have a Brand, Name, type, description and images. They can also have multiple sales formats eg 1, 10 (boite nature), 25 (SLB) etc and i need to be able to add multiple purchase options (Retailer, price, link) for each sales format. Cigars should also be taggable and there should be an easy way to view all cigars with a certain tag.
